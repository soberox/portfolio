# Portfolio
  This is my professional portfolio where I will store all my notable projects, introduce myself, and provide ways to connect. This is still an early version of what I imagine, and soon enough I will host it on the web. Currently there is a static version, where the contact functionality won’t be available. Still feel free to contact me through GitHub or my LinkedIn. Here you'll learn more about me and my goals. You'll also be updated with the latest new things that I'm working on. You'll also see my development in this field, as my skills and toolset expand. If you made it this far, I'll be happy to hear your thoughts and how I can improve in the future!
